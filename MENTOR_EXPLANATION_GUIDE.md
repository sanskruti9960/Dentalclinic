# 🦷 Smita Dental Clinic & Implant Centre - Java Spring Boot Architecture Guide

This comprehensive document explains every single Java file, its architectural responsibility, design patterns, and exact points to present to your mentor.

---

## 🏛️ Overall Architectural Design

The project strictly follows the **Enterprise 4-Tier Layered Architecture** (Industry Standard Spring Boot MVC):

```
Client (Web / Mobile / React / cURL)
        │  HTTP / JSON (RESTful)
        ▼
[1. Controller Layer]   (@RestController) -> Validates requests, maps HTTP verbs, returns DTOs/Entities
        │
        ▼
[2. Service Layer]      (@Service, @Transactional) -> Business logic (chair conflict checks, tax calculations, tooth charting)
        │
        ▼
[3. Repository Layer]   (@Repository) -> Spring Data JPA interfaces generating dynamic SQL via Hibernate
        │
        ▼
[4. Model / Database]   (@Entity) -> Relational database tables (H2 In-Memory / PostgreSQL)
```

### Key Design Patterns Implemented:
1. **MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)**: Decouples endpoints, business operations, and persistence.
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts database queries using Spring Data JPA.
3. **Data Transfer Object (DTO) Pattern**: Decouples API contract from internal JPA entity structures.
4. **Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Spring Framework manages lifecycle of beans through constructor injection.
5. **Transactional Boundary Pattern**: `@Transactional` ensures atomic database commits and rollbacks on errors.

|---|---|
| `AuthRequest.java` / `AuthResponse.java` | Carries login credentials and returns JWT bearer token and user role. |

### 6. Business Service Layer (`com.dentalclinic.service` & `impl`)

Contains the core business rules, transactional guarantees, and workflow logic.

| File Name | Core Business Logic to Explain |
|---|---|
| `UserServiceImpl.java` | Authenticates users, validates duplicate emails, generates tokens, and creates linked patient profiles upon registration. |
| `PatientServiceImpl.java` | Creates patient profile, assigns sequential ID `SDC-2026-xxx`, and automatically initializes 32 healthy tooth records for their Odontogram. |
| `AppointmentServiceImpl.java` | **Chair Conflict Detection:** Checks if chair 1, 2, or 3 is already occupied at the given time before booking. Calculates daily slot availability for patients. Dispatches SMS confirmation. |
| `BillingServiceImpl.java` | Calculates subtotal, applies discount and GST tax, computes balance due, updates patient ledger, and records partial or full payments. |

### 8. Configuration & Seeds (`com.dentalclinic.config`)

| File Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SecurityConfig.java` | Spring Security filter chain. Enables stateless REST API requests, disables CSRF for API endpoints, and permits Swagger UI & H2 console. |

## 💡 Top 5 Questions Mentors Ask & How to Answer

### Q1: "How does the system prevent double-booking on the same dental chair?"
> **Answer:** In `AppointmentServiceImpl.java`, the `bookAppointment()` method executes a conflict query `appointmentRepository.findByChairAndDate()`. If any existing appointment on that chair and date shares the requested time and is not cancelled, it throws an `IllegalStateException`, rejecting the duplicate booking. Furthermore, `getDoctorScheduleSlots()` returns `AppointmentSlotDto` indicating whether each slot is already occupied so patients can clearly see the doctor's busy schedule before booking.

### Q2: "How is the Dental Chart (Odontogram) modeled in the relational database?"
> **Answer:** We have a `ToothRecord` entity mapped to the `tooth_records` table with a composite unique constraint `(patient_id, tooth_number)`. Tooth numbers range from 1 to 32 (FDI / Universal adult notation). When a new patient registers in `PatientServiceImpl.java`, it initializes 32 `ToothRecord` entries with default status `HEALTHY`. When the doctor marks Caries, RCT, or Crown, `updateToothCondition()` updates that specific tooth record.

### Q3: "What design pattern is used between the Controller and the Database?"
> **Answer:** We use the **Repository Pattern** and **Service Layer Pattern**. The Controller delegates to the Service interface (e.g. `AppointmentService`), which encapsulates business rules and transaction boundaries with `@Transactional`. The Service interacts with `AppointmentRepository`, which extends Spring Data JPA's `JpaRepository` to abstract low-level JDBC and SQL generation.

### Q4: "How does Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) work?"
> **Answer:** We use `UserRole` enum (`DOCTOR` vs `PATIENT`). When a user logs in, the `AuthResponse` returns their role and linked profile ID (`patientId`). In Spring Security (`SecurityConfig.java`), endpoints can be restricted by role. In notifications, the system dispatches alerts targeted specifically to `DOCTOR`, `PATIENT`, or `BOTH`.

### Q5: "How are financial invoices and partial payments tracked?"
> **Answer:** In `Invoice.java`, we maintain `grandTotal`, `amountPaid`, and `balanceDue`. When a payment is recorded via `BillingServiceImpl.recordPayment()`, `amountPaid` is incremented and `balanceDue` is recalculated. If `balanceDue == 0`, status changes to `PAID`; if partially paid, to `PARTIAL`. The patient's running total in `Patient.java` (`balanceDue` and `totalSpent`) is also updated atomically within the same database transaction.
